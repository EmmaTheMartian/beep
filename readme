Technically made because I wanted to mess around with RSS,
but I also wanted a teensy little blog/slow-paced-chat-app
for myself and my friends.

You'll need a PostgreSQL database somewhere, along with V
to compile beep:

$ git clone https://github.com/emmathemartian/beep
$ cd beep
$ v -prod .

Copy the `config.maple` as `config.real.maple`

$ cp config.maple config.real.maple

Edit `config.real.maple` to set the URL, port, DB username,
password, and name.

`config.real.maple` also has settings to configure the
default theme, post length, username length, welcome
messages, etc etc.

WARNING: DO NOT PUT SECRETS IN `config.maple`.
`config.maple` is intended to be pushed to Git as a
"template config." Instead, use `config.real.maple` if you
plan to push anywhere. It's gitignored by default, i.e, an
accidental exclusion in the gitignore and push won't expose
your keys.

$ ./beep config.real.maple

Then go to the configured port to view (default is
`http://localhost:8008`).

If you don't have a database, you can either self-host a
psql database on your machine, or you can find a free one
online. I like [neon.tech](https://neon.tech), their free
plan is pretty comfortable for a small beep instance!
