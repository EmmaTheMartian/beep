# todo

> i use `:` to denote categories

## in-progress

- [ ] post:mentioning ('tagging') other users in posts

## planing

- [ ] post:replies
- [ ] post:tags ('hashtags')
- [ ] post:images (should have a config.maple toggle to enable/disable)
- [ ] post:saving (add the post to a list of saved posts that a user can view later)
- [ ] user:deletion

## ideas

- [ ] user:per-user post pins
	- could be used as an alternative for a bio to include more information perhaps

## done

- [x] user:nicknames
- [x] user:bio/about me
- [x] user:listed pronouns
- [x] post:likes/dislikes
- [ ] ~~site:stylesheet (and a toggle for html-only mode)~~
	- replaced with per-user optional stylesheets
- [x] site:message of the day (admins can add a welcome message displayed on index.html)
