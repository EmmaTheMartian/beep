## in-progress

- [ ] post:embedded links (links added to a post will be embedded into the post
as images, music links, etc)
	- should have special handling for spotify, apple music, youtube,
	discord, and other common links. we want those ones to look fancy!

## planing

> p.s. when initially writing "planing," i made a typo. it should be "planning."
> however, i will not be fixing it, because it is funny.
